A Tuple is an ordered list of items. A Tuple Space is a form of associative memory where entries, tuples, are stored in the space and are retrieved using search criteria that are based on the intrinsic properties of the tuples. The two key operations are 

put
get

There are refinements on these operations including, for example, timeouts where the tuple will only exist for a given period and also transactions that are based on atomic actions and commit/rollback in the tuplespace.
